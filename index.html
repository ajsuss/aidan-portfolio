      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m a passionate mechanical and mechatronics engineer with a deep enthusiasm for designing, controlling and applying robotic systems in the real world. My studies at <strong>UC&nbsp;Berkeley</strong> (B.S. Mechanical Engineering, minor in EECS, May&nbsp;2024; M.S. Mechanical Engineering, May&nbsp;2025) and hands‑on experiences at Tesla, UC&nbsp;Berkeley labs and competition teams have shaped a broad skillset including CAD (SolidWorks, CATIA, Fusion&nbsp;360), FEA/FEM, control algorithms (PID, UKF, EKF, PF), embedded programming (C/C++, Python, ROS) and pneumatic/electro‑mechanical system integration. </p>
      <p>Beyond formal coursework I’ve led and contributed to projects ranging from battlebots and flywheel‑stabilized bicycles to CNC plotters, autonomous rovers and signal‑processing algorithms. I thrive on rapid prototyping and iterative design, and I’m driven by the challenge of turning ambitious ideas into robust, manufacturable hardware.</p>

    <h3>Automated Pneumatic Tooling – Tesla Equipment Engineering Internship</h3>
    <p><strong>Project overview:</strong> Facilitated creation of a fully automated press to install coolant‑pump mounting brackets, replacing a manual choke point and improving cycle time on the Tesla assembly line.</p>
    <p><strong>Mechanical design highlights:</strong> Designed a custom fixture that matched bracket and pump profiles for positive seating and 3D printed it in durable resin. Built an extrusion‑rail frame with a linear‑guide sliding tray for part loading/unloading. Added a tailored pressing foot with an integrated indicator for seating verification.</p>
    <p><strong>Process workflow:</strong> Operators load parts into the fixture and engage dual safety buttons. The tray retracts into a semi‑enclosed chamber where a pneumatic piston press‑fits the bracket. Upon seating confirmation, releasing the buttons reverses the sequence.</p>
    <p><strong>Pneumatic logic:</strong> Implemented a purely pneumatic logic system: dual buttons act as an AND gate enabling tray actuation; an end‑of‑travel switch activates the pressing piston via a 5/2 valve. Sequencing is achieved using 5/2 and 3/2 directional valves and pilot lines with regulated air at 60–80 psi.</p>
    <p><strong>Safety &amp; ergonomics:</strong> Integrated pinch‑point guards, full acrylic panels, color‑coded warning labels and two‑hand operation for safety.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcomes &amp; scalability:</strong> Reduced cycle time below takt, eliminating the previous bottleneck. Machine footprint accommodates two fixtures in parallel; the maintenance guide outlines how to scale multiple units from a single air‑logic bank.</p>

  <template id="robobears">
    <h3>RoboBears Combat Robot</h3>
    <p><strong>Overview:</strong> Designed, sourced and built a 3 lb battlebot with an active drum weapon to disable competitors while minimizing incoming damage.</p>
    <p><strong>Initial design process:</strong> Conducted a design‑matrix analysis of past combat‑robot competitions, prioritizing high maneuverability, invertibility, stability and damage. Selected a drum‑bot architecture with a slanted flipper for improved contact and bite.</p>
    <p><strong>Modifications:</strong> To overcome poor defense of a traditional front‑facing drum, devised a weapon system with two drum segments at a 120° angle, enabling side attacks and 360° defense. Initial single‑motor designs suffered belt slippage; switching to dual motors improved reliability despite a slight reduction in per‑hit force.</p>
    <p><strong>Final design and manufacturability:</strong> Fabricated a laser‑cut 6061‑aluminum chassis with pocket patterns for stiffness‑to‑weight optimization and welded assembly. Waterjet‑cut A2‑steel drum sections were welded to a live shaft and constrained with nylon springs. The drive train used two direct‑drive 750 RPM planetary gear motors and a front ball caster for invertibility; low‑friction tape on the caster bolt enabled self‑righting.</p>
    <p><strong>Contributions &amp; takeaways:</strong> Utilized SolidWorks and FEA tools to optimize the design, performed abstracted simulations of drum impacts to set load cases, sourced all components and prepared a detailed bill of materials and manufacturing plan.</p>
  </template>

  <template id="flywheel">
    <h3>Flywheel Bicycle Balancer – Mechatronics Design Capstone (ME102)</h3>
    <p><strong>Project overview:</strong> Conceived a flywheel‑based add‑on module that lets bicycles self‑correct lean at low speeds via a gyroscopic assist.</p>
    <p><strong>Core concept &amp; architecture:</strong> An inverted‑pendulum flywheel stores angular momentum; a brushless DC motor repositions the flywheel to deliver counter‑torque and re‑center the bicycle. A magnetic encoder measures lean angle, while an ESP32 computes corrective action and drives the motor through a VESC controller.</p>
    <p><strong>Key design decisions:</strong> Selected a high‑power‑density brushless motor (Scorpion SII‑4035‑450 KV). Designed a steel flywheel using a Lagrangian energy model to provide stabilizing torque while keeping weight manageable. Chose a Maytech 100 A VESC, optical quadrature encoder and balanced flywheel weights.</p>
    <p><strong>Embedded control &amp; software:</strong> Implemented firmware on the ESP32 in C++/Arduino with state‑variable current control; tuned PID‑like gains via bench testing. A state machine governs startup, balancing and fault shutdown. Modular encoder and IMU drivers enable future upgrades.</p>
    <p><strong>Accomplishments:</strong> Demonstrated live low‑speed balance correction counteracting gusts, uneven terrain and rider shifts. Fabricated, wired and programmed a functional prototype within six weeks, culminating in a successful showcase.</p>
    <p><strong>Challenges &amp; lessons:</strong> Encountered latency and control saturation in the VESC; higher‑resolution sensors and refined control schemes would further improve response.</p>
  </template>

  <template id="chessbot">
    <h3>ChessBot – EECS SawyerBot Lab</h3>
    <p><strong>Project goal:</strong> Programmed the Sawyer robotic arm to play chess against a human opponent by detecting the human’s moves, computing a response via Stockfish and executing it autonomously.</p>
    <p><strong>Physical design:</strong> 3D‑printed uniform chess pieces for reliable gripping and placed AR markers on the board and clock to enable camera‑based pose estimation.</p>
    <p><strong>Perception:</strong> Used ROS’s <code>ar_track_alvar</code> node to detect AR tags and compute the board’s pose. Mapped board squares into the Sawyer workspace for precise targeting.</p>
    <p><strong>Game logic:</strong> A ROS node maintained the chess state. After each human move, a custom ROS service called the Stockfish engine to plan the robot’s response.</p>
    <p><strong>Motion planning &amp; control:</strong> Converted piece‑and‑square commands into joint trajectories using ROS MoveIt and an inverse‑kinematics solver. Executed trajectories with a custom‑tuned PID controller for smooth placement.</p>
    <p><strong>Results:</strong> Sawyer autonomously plays full games, moving its chosen pieces accurately and demonstrating seamless integration of perception, planning and control.</p>

  <template id="plotter">
    <h3>CNC Pen Plotter – Microprocessor‑Based Systems</h3>
    <p><strong>Project overview:</strong> Developed a CNC pen plotter that translates digital drawings into precise disconnected line art, with a custom pen‑retraction mechanism for rapid tool lifts.</p>
    <p><strong>Mechanical design highlights:</strong> Constructed an open‑frame XY gantry using extrusion rails driven by dual stepper motors and DRV8825 microstepping. Added limit‑switch homing and drag‑chain cable management. Employed compact 3D‑printed brackets and datum features for repeatable assembly.</p>
    <p><strong>Pen lifter mechanism:</strong> Designed a servo‑driven slider converting rotary motion into vertical pen lift via a linkage. Idle servo torque and pen compression eliminated the need for a return spring. Adjustable mounting bracket with chamfered pegs, datum holes and threaded inserts ensured alignment; a limit‑switch stopper enforced consistent travel.</p>
    <p><strong>Hardware &amp; integration:</strong> Utilized an ESP32 control board running FluidNC firmware and DRV8825 drivers. The pen lifter mounts on the Z‑axis carriage while the X/Y axes are driven by GT2 belts and T‑slot sliders.</p>
    <p><strong>Software &amp; firmware:</strong> Programmed FluidNC for motion control and built a Python/Tkinter GUI for G‑code generation, real‑time plotting and low‑level commands such as E‑stop, home and reset.</p>
    <p><strong>Outcomes:</strong> Achieved clean, disconnected strokes on both whiteboard and paper. Tool‑swap snap‑fit posts support multiple pen sizes, laying the foundation for a future automatic tool changer. Real‑time feedback via MQTT ensures synchronous drawing.</p>

  <template id="mappingcar">
    <h3>Ultrasonic Mapping Car – Electronics for IoT</h3>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> Designed and built a small‑scale rover combining object detection, obstacle avoidance and environmental mapping to demonstrate core IoT robotics principles.</p>
    <p><strong>Core hardware:</strong> ESP32 microcontroller running MicroPython; two 9 V DC motors driven by a custom NPN‑BJT H‑bridge with flyback diodes; wheel encoders for odometry; HC‑SR04 ultrasonic sensor for distance measurement; 9 V battery with on‑board 5 V regulator and logic‑level shifting.</p>

    <h3>MATLAB Beam‑Analysis Project – Solid Mechanics (MEC85)</h3>
    <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Automate shear, moment and stress analysis of a simply supported beam under a point load <em>F</em>=100 N and a uniformly distributed load <em>w</em>=10 N/cm, then size a circular cross‑section such that the maximum principal stress remains below 270 MPa.</p>
    <p><strong>Major deliverables:</strong> Hand‑derived shear‑force and bending‑moment diagrams for validation. Four MATLAB scripts: <code>vmd.m</code> computes <em>V(x)</em> and <em>M(x)</em>; <code>stress.m</code> evaluates shear, bending and principal stresses for a given diameter; <code>caseEqual.m</code> implements a bisection algorithm to find the minimum diameter when <em>l₁</em>=<em>l₂</em>; <code>caseGeneral.m</code> sweeps <em>l₁</em> from 2–10 cm to generate a design‑diameter envelope.</p>
    <p><strong>Analytical &amp; computational workflow:</strong> Calculated support reactions via equilibrium and implemented closed‑form expressions for <em>V(x)</em> and <em>M(x)</em> sampled at 100 points in MATLAB. Constructed principal‑stress tensors using <em>σ</em>=<em>My/I</em> and <em>τ</em>=<em>VQ/It</em>, extracted maximum principal stress via eigenvalues and used bisection to size the diameter so <em>σ<sub>max</sub></em>≈270 MPa (±0.01 MPa).</p>
    <p><strong>Plotting results:</strong> Generated diagrams of the beam problem setup, shear &amp; moment diagrams, the minimum diameter for <em>l₁</em>=<em>l₂</em> and a design‑diameter envelope. These automated plots aid engineers in quickly sizing beams for different load distributions.</p>

    <h3>Exoplanet Habitability Research – ULab</h3>
    <p><strong>Background:</strong> Used the transit method to analyze dips in starlight when an exoplanet passes in front of its host star. This approach allows estimation of orbital radius, transit period and planet size.</p>
    <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> Selected a target exoplanet (HAT‑P‑12b) using MicroObservatory and collected 80–90 images during a transit event. Cleaned the brightness data in Python to produce light curves and highlight outliers, then employed polynomial fits to identify the transit.</p>
    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Plotted relative brightness versus time, removed noisy images and created binned light curves. Calculated key characteristics such as planet radius, velocity and semi‑major axis. Compared these values to known habitable planets and found that HAT‑P‑12b is significantly larger and faster than Earth and resides outside its star’s habitable zone.</p>
    <p><strong>Future work:</strong> Suggested using spectroscopy to determine atmospheric composition and investigating a larger sample of exoplanets, potentially incorporating habitability indices such as the Earth Similarity Index.</p>
