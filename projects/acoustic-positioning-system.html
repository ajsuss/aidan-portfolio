    <h2>Project Goal</h2>
    <p>The aim of this EECS 16A lab was to build a GPS‑style indoor positioning system that estimates a microphone’s 2D location based on beacon tones emitted from multiple loudspeakers.</p>
    <h2>Core Concepts Applied</h2>
    <p>We employed cross‑correlation to isolate each beacon’s signal and measure its sample delay. Distances were derived from these delays via the speed of sound. A position estimate was computed using trilateration or least‑squares optimisation.</p>
    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>Composite audio from four speakers broadcasting orthogonal tones was recorded, cross‑correlation peaks were used to determine sample offsets, and offsets were converted into distances. A least‑squares solver in Python produced the estimated microphone position, which was compared to ground truth.</p>
    <h2>Tools &amp; Technologies</h2>
    <p>Python with JupyterLab and NumPy was used for analysis, along with a standard PC microphone and desktop speakers.</p>
    <h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>
    <p>The lab demonstrated digital signal processing, linear‑algebra modelling, hardware/software integration and presentation of algorithms and results.</p>
    <h2>Media &amp; Downloads</h2>
    <p>Python scripts, data sets and reports will be provided here.</p>
