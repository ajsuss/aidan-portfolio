    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>As part of Cal’s combat robotics team, I designed, sourced and built a 3 lb battlebot with an active drum weapon. The goal was to disable opponents while minimising incoming damage and ensuring invertibility and maneuverability.</p>
    <h2>Initial Design Process</h2>
    <p>I began with a design‑matrix analysis of past combat‑robot competitions, weighing criteria like agility, stability and offensive capability. This led to choosing a drum‑bot architecture with a slanted flipper to improve engagement and bite on the opponent.</p>
    <h2>Modifications</h2>
    <p>Early prototypes featuring a single drum revealed poor defense against side impacts and belt slippage. I addressed these issues by devising a weapon system with two drum segments placed 120° apart, enabling side attacks and full 360° defense. Switching from a single to dual motor drive improved reliability at the cost of some per‑hit energy.</p>
    <h2>Final Design &amp; Manufacturability</h2>
    <p>The chassis was laser‑cut from 6061‑T6 aluminum with pockets to optimise stiffness‑to‑weight. Waterjet‑cut A2‑steel drum sections were welded to a live shaft and constrained with nylon springs. The drive train used two direct‑drive planetary gear motors and a front ball caster for invertibility. Low‑friction tape on the caster bolt enabled self‑righting after flips.</p>
    <h2>Contributions &amp; Takeaways</h2>
    <p>I employed SolidWorks and FEA tools to optimise the design and performed abstracted simulations of drum impacts to set load cases. I also sourced components, prepared the bill of materials and developed a detailed manufacturing plan. Through this project I gained hands‑on experience with rapid prototyping, iterative design and competitive robot combat strategy.</p>

    <!-- CAD video loops showing dynamic rotations of the assembly and weapon system -->
    <h3>CAD Videos</h3>
    <p>Below are two short video loops that animate the RoboBears CAD assembly. The first loop rotates the full robot through 360° to showcase its geometry, while the second focuses on the drum weapon subsystem. These MP4 files live in the repository root (alongside <code>index.html</code>); if you later move them into a <code>videos</code> folder be sure to update the <code>src</code> paths accordingly.</p>
