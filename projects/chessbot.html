    <h2>Project Goal</h2>
    <p>The aim of this EECS lab was to program the Sawyer robotic arm to play chess against a human opponent. The system detects the human’s moves, computes a response using the Stockfish engine and executes it autonomously.</p>
    <h2>Physical Design</h2>
    <p>To ensure reliable gripping, I designed and 3D‑printed uniform chess pieces and attached AR markers to the board and clock. These markers enabled camera‑based pose estimation for each square within the robot’s workspace.</p>
    <h2>Perception</h2>
    <p>Using ROS’s <code>ar_track_alvar</code> package, the vision system detected AR tags and computed the board’s pose. Board squares were mapped into the Sawyer arm’s coordinate frame for precise targeting.</p>
    <h2>Game Logic</h2>
    <p>A ROS node maintained the chess state. After each human move, a custom ROS service called the Stockfish engine to plan the robot’s response, ensuring legal and strategic moves.</p>
    <h2>Motion Planning &amp; Control</h2>
    <p>Piece and square commands were converted into joint trajectories using ROS MoveIt and an inverse‑kinematics solver. A custom‑tuned PID controller executed trajectories smoothly and accurately.</p>
    <h2>Results</h2>
    <p>The Sawyer robot successfully played full games of chess autonomously, moving its chosen pieces accurately and demonstrating seamless integration of perception, planning and control.</p>
    <h2>Media &amp; Downloads</h2>
    <p>Design files, ROS packages and demonstration videos will be provided here.</p>
